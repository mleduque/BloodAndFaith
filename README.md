Premise: Too often, criminals get away with their misdeeds for one reason or another. A certain Lathanderite cleric wants to change that, but she needs your help. This is a tale of blood and faith, a tale of damnation… or of redemption.  

Features:  
- 14 quests! 
- Emphasis on roleplay
- Evil Charnames can optionally turn neutral, depending on how you complete the questline!
- Good Charnames can optionally turn neutral, depending on how you complete the questline!
- Neutral Charnames can optionally turn good or evil, depending on how you complete the questline!
- Suitable for any class/alignment! There’s justification for evil PCs and the Lathanderite to work together
- Two endings!
- 8,000+ words of dialogue!
- Additional lore-friendly Lore, featuring gods like Malar and Ibrandul!
- A new cleric/thief of Lathander, who just might become a possible companion in BG2

--------------

None known. Let me know if you find any.


--------------
#### WALKTHROUGH
--------------

See [separate walkthrough document](https://github.com/Glittergear/BloodAndFaith/blob/main/BloodAndFaith/Blood%20and%20Faith%20Walkthrough%20v1.0%2B.pdf).


--------------
#### KNOWN ISSUES
--------------

- The Renegade Zhent in the Cloakwood sometimes turns hostile if you have Party AI on.  
- Depending on your in-game audio preferences, Eloran might be a bit quiet. If that's the case, you can go into your audio preferences in-game and either turn up the NPC voices or turn down the background music.
- Depending on your in-game audio preferences, the final boss might also be a bit quiet.

If you find anything else, ping me on Discord or post it to the G3 forums.


--------------
#### FINAL BOSS
--------------

- There is a 5% change that you will get the easter egg final boss instead of the regular one. This came from a conversation and joke that Max and I had. Both final bosses are equally difficult; the tone is just very very different.
- If you can't beat the final boss: Sorcerous Sundries sells potion of clarity and scrolls of Resist Fear and a scroll of slow, which should help. He's immune to fear, but he's not immune to confusion and feeblemind, so if worst comes to worst, you can try that.
- Why don't Xzar/Monty talk with the final boss? Final boss considers them acceptable collateral damage, and thus doesn't care to talk to them.
