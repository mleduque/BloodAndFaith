@7500 = ~Oh, you’re the one the Lathanderite’s sent? The ghost is upstairs. Please do something about it! He keeps going on about coins.~
@7501 = ~What can you tell me about this ghost?~
@7502 = ~He keeps going on about coins?~
@7503 = ~I have no further questions.~
@7504 = ~I don’t know much about him! I just moved here from Daggerford! He died, obviously, and so the wife sold the house. I think she’s staying at the Red Sheaf until she gets her affairs in order to move to Baldur’s Gate.~
@7505 = ~Yes, he does that. But I already bought the house from his widow; I’m not giving him money too! ~
@7506 = ~Hopefully you have a few ideas about what to do here. I don’t want to live in a haunted house, and I don’t think I can sell the place now.~
@7507 = ~The ghost is gone!~
@7508 = ~The ghost is gone now. He just wanted his coin collection.~
@7509 = ~That's correct.~
@7510 = ~His coin collection? That’s it? Hmph. What’s a ghost going to do with money, anyway? Well, whatever gets him out of my house. Thank you for your help.~
@7511 = ~Well, then not to be rude, but could you leave? This is my house, after all, and not yours.~
@7512 = ~Thank you for your help.~
