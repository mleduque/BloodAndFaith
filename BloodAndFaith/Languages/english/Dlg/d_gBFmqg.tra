@13000 = ~Yes? Can I help you?~
@13001 = ~So ya used to be an adventurer, right? What happened?~
@13002 = ~I saw one too many deaths, and then decided to retire.~
@13003 = ~Oh. But you’re a cleric. You couldn’t resurrect them?~
@13004 = ~I wasn’t always a cleric. Why do you ask?~
@13005 = ~No real reason. Just making some conversation. What were you before a cleric?~
@13006 = ~Whatever I needed to be, really. Though I think <CHARNAME> might need you? I think <PRO_HESHE> is getting a little antsy. We’ll continue this some other time.~
@13007 = ~Yes, Imoen?~
@13008 = ~So, what did ya need to be before you were a cleric?~
@13009 = ~What?~
@13010 = ~You said last time that you weren’t always a cleric, remember? And you promised we’d continue this conversation later.~
@13011 = ~Ah. Right. I suppose I did. Well, before I was a cleric, I was very good at getting where I wasn’t supposed to be, and finding things I wasn’t supposed to have. It kept me alive.~
@13012 = ~And then what?~
@13013 = ~And then I became a cleric of Lathander.~
@13014 = ~What? That’s *it*?! That can’t be the whole story.~
@13015 = ~It’s not, but that’s the story you’re getting. Now, can I interest you in some potions, or…?~
@13016 = ~So, which secret society are you in?~
@13017 = ~...what?~
@13018 = ~You’re in a secret society. Or at least, were. That’s why you’re so secretive and cagey about your past. And that’s why you had thief skills. So, which society was it?~
@13019 = ~You’re not going to let this go, are you?~
@13020 = ~Nope.~
@13021 = ~I’m not in a secret society now, and it wasn’t a secret society then. It’s just… not something I enjoy talking about. I’m a cleric now for a reason, and I hope you never understand why.~
@13022 = ~Yes, Kivan, wasn’t it? I’m sorry we weren’t able to talk much when you first visited, and I hope Thalantyr had what you were looking for.~
@13023 = ~What do you know of the bandits in this area?~
@13024 = ~Not much. I have other concerns in my day-to-day.~
@13025 = ~Other concerns.~
@13026 = ~That’s not how I meant it. Yes, I am concerned about the bandits, but I’m letting the paladins and clerics handle it. As is their wont.~
@13027 = ~Then what do you concern yourself with?~
@13028 = ~The affairs of the temple, mostly. Nothing spectacular. Writing letters of gratitude to the more generous tithers, ensuring the temple is stocked, brewing the occasional potion, and so on. Not much to do with bandits, I’m afraid.~
@13029 = ~And you concern yourself with nothing else?~
@13030 = ~Of course not. If that was everything, then I would never have heard of Bassilus or anyone else I send you after now, would I?~
@13031 = ~Kivan, do you believe in redemption?~
@13032 = ~For myself or others?~
@13033 = ~Is there a difference?~
@13034 = ~For me, there is no redemption. There can only be forgiveness.~
@13035 = ~Perhaps we’re more similar than we might think. ~
@13036 = ~I would hope not. For both of our sakes.~
@13037 = ~Your ears… how long have you had them?~
@13038 = ~Excuse me?~
@13039 = ~They weren’t originally yours, were they? They look… human. But you’re not human, are you? I can see it in your eyes.~
@13040 = ~These are my ears, and I have always had them. Are we quite done here?~
@13041 = ~And here I thought you might have an appreciation for the Craft. Maybe if we traded eyes, we could see things differently. Some other time perhaps.~
@13042 = ~What is it, necromancer?~
@13043 = ~Have you thought about it? About trading eyes?~
@13044 = ~I… can’t say that I have.~
@13045 = ~Oh. How disappointing. But you have infravision like the elves, don’t you? I’ve always wanted that too, but ‘tis more than taking their eyes. I’ve tried, but elvish eyes don’t suit me. They don’t work very well and don’t compliment my complexion at all. But *your* eyes–~
@13046 = ~No. The answer is no. ~
@13047 = ~Do I want to know what you’re thinking about this time?~
@13048 = ~Your tongue.~
@13049 = ~Your ears and eyes are… peculiar. But your tongue is familiar. How long have you been away from the Moonsea?~
@13050 = ~Longer than you, most likely. Can’t say I miss it.~
@13051 = ~Neither can I. The Sword Coast is so lovely this time of year.~
@13052 = ~I think we could make a good team. I'm looking for someone who will be able to bring justice and hope to the Sword Coast. It’ll be similar to bounty hunting, but you needn’t worry about ethical considerations—I am very good at researching targets, and I swear on the Morninglord that I will only send you after evil. What do you say?~ [b_gIntro]
@13053 = ~You realize that I’m a necromancer, right?~
@13054 = ~You see I'm travelling with Dorn, right?~
@13055 = ~You see I'm travelling with Tiax, right?~
@13056 = ~You see I'm travelling with Xzar, right?~
@13057 = ~You see I'm travelling with Viconia, right?~
@13058 = ~You do realize I'm Sharran, right?~
@13059 = ~What exactly do you expect me to do?~
@13060 = ~What are the rewards?~
@13061 = ~What kind of Lathanderite are you, seeking to hire a bounty hunter?~
@13062 = ~I'll do it.~
@13063 = ~No thanks.~
@13064 = ~I think we could make a good team, despite our differences. I'm looking for someone who will be able to bring justice and hope to the Sword Coast—and I don’t care if you believe in such things or not, because I have a feeling that you believe in rewards. The Temple of Lathander is both wealthy and generous. What do you say?~ [b_eInt]
@13065 = ~I noticed. But I also know that not all necromancers are evil or heretics. There are plenty of non-heretical ways to practice arcane necromancy. And besides, who knows necromancers and undead better than necromancers themselves? Anything else?~
@13066 = ~I did notice, yes. He’s rather hard to miss. But Lathander preaches redemption, and how can Evil redeem itself if not given a chance? Anything else?~ [b_mNot]
@13067 = ~I did notice, yes. She’s rather hard to miss. But Lathander preaches redemption, and how can Evil redeem itself if not given a chance? Anything else?~ [b_fNot]
@13068 = ~I did notice, yes. Rather odd that you would just announce that though—I thought your faith preached secrecy? Regardless, don’t you believe in personal loss and darkening your soul to find truth? What darkens one’s soul more than killing? And besides, Lathander preaches redemption, and how can you redeem yourself if not given a chance? Consider this an opportunity… one that will either strengthen or weaken your faith. I wonder which it will be. Anything else?~ [b_sNot]
@13069 = ~I’ll point you towards something, and you go solve it. Usually, this will mean smiting undead or collecting a bounty. But do keep in mind that violence isn’t always the only option. Sometimes words are the greatest weapon. But if words don’t work, I’ve found that a well-placed dagger often does the trick. Anything else?~ [b_whExp]
@13070 = ~You mean materially? Gold, mostly. Some potions or magical trinkets here and there. It will be rather straightforward. You’ll gain experience as well, which is vital for any adventurer. I’ll try not to throw you in over your head; it wouldn’t do for either of us for you to get killed—I’d be out of a field-worker, and you’d be out of, well, your life. Bad for the both of us. Anything else?~ [b_whPr]
@13071 = ~A practical one, of course. Someone has to solve these problems, and Morninglord knows that the Flaming Fist won’t. We have paladins, but they…. Well, some of these tasks require subtlety and discretion, and paladins aren't known for having either. I used to be able to do all these tasks myself, but my duties and old injuries keep me confined indoors. Anything else?~ [b_whyMe]
@13072 = ~That’s unfortunate. I’ll be here if you change your mind.~ [b_no]
@13073 = ~Just what I was hoping to hear. I hope you’re ready to get started soon—if not right away. There’s a house here in Beregost that’s haunted by a ghost. The big yellowish house with the blue roof across from the Burning Wizard. See if you can find a way to get rid of it. Any questions? ~ [b_yes]
@13074 = ~Any advice?~
@13075 = ~You seem capable—why are you sending me to do this?~
@13076 = ~No questions. I'm on it.~
@13077 = ~Lingering spirits often linger for a reason. If you manage to kill it, it may just come back. Not all problems can be solved with steel and violence. See what it wants and see if you can fulfill its wish. Anything else?~ [gh_ad]
@13078 = ~We are more effective and useful in some places, than in others. To be blunt, I am more useful in the temple than you would be. I believe that you can handle this, so why not send you in my stead? And how else would you gain experience? Adventurers without experience tend to die rather quickly. Anything else?~ [gh_whyme]
@13079 = ~Good. Lathander go with you.~ [gh_noQs]
@13080 = ~Go solve the haunting, <CHARNAME>.~ [gh_goSo]
@13081 = ~Anything to report?~ [gh_back]
@13082 = ~The ghost wanted to be buried with his coin collection. I found the collection, handed it over, and then he left peacefully.~
@13083 = ~Good work, <CHARNAME>. Take these potions as a reward. You’ve earned them, and they’ll prove useful in this next task, I suspect. Remember how I said that not all problems can be solved with violence? Well, I have a feeling that this problem can *only* be solved with violence. Travelers have been disappearing between Beregost and the Friendly Arm Inn. At first, we thought it was bandits. Eventually, there was a survivor, and we now know that this is no bandit—this is a follower of Malar. Malarites believe that only the strongest deserve to survive, and so violence is the only language that they understand. Find the Malarite in the Coast Way and kill him. Any questions?~ [mal_st]
@13084 = ~What can you tell me about Malar?~
@13085 = ~Should I at least try to talk to him? I thought Lathander believes in redemption.~
@13086 = ~Why are you sending me on this mission? I could die.~
@13087 = ~Any idea where the Malarite is hiding?~
@13088 = ~No more questions. I’m on it.~
@13089 = ~Malar is the malevolent god of the hunt. Bloodthirsty, feral, and savage, he encourages the worst in his followers, and they revel in such things. He has an alliance with deities like Lolth and Loviatar, insofar as they are capable of having alliances. Bloodthirsty and violent deities aren’t the most… well, they don’t cooperate well with others. Expect some sort of predator-prey dynamic or a very twisted game of hide-and-seek. Anything else?~ [mal_ex]
@13090 = ~Lathander does believe in redemption, but he's not naïve. Neither am I. People must want to change to do so. Doubtful that this Malarite wants to change, and we can’t wait on a decision that may never happen, especially when people are dying in the meantime. Anything else?~ [mal_na]
@13091 = ~If a commoner managed to escape this Malarite, I’m sure you’ll be fine. And I just gave you a few healing potions.~ [mal_fi]
@13092 = ~The latest victims were traveling with a single wagon and didn’t make it very far north. I’d look for a hidden entrance in the southernmost cliffs of the Coast Way.~ [mal_wh]
@13093 = ~Good. May Lathander light your way to victory. And here, some gold for solving the haunting.~ [mal_co]
@13094 = ~Don’t rush but do hurry. The longer you take, the more time he has to snatch someone else.~ [mal_hu]
@13095 = ~The Malarite is dead.~
@13096 = ~Good work, <CHARNAME>. I knew you could do it! But tell me, <CHARNAME>… how did this last mission make you feel?~ [mal_how]
@13097 = ~What kind of question is that?~
@13098 = ~I… I don’t know. How should I feel?~
@13099 = ~Terrible. I didn’t want to kill the Malarite, but…~
@13100 = ~It felt fine. Why wouldn’t it?~
@13101 = ~It was a good challenge. I enjoyed it, to be honest.~
@13102 = ~You’re young, inexperienced, and largely unused to killing people, aren’t you? I want to make sure that you’re okay, and ready for the next mission. Now, answer the question. How did killing the Malarite feel?~ [mal_an]
@13103 = ~I can’t tell you that. I don’t know myself. Satisfied at a job well done? Horrified that it had to come to this? Malar would be pleased with you for your victory, I think, even though you killed one of his followers. You were the stronger, after all. Now, sort yourself out, <CHARNAME>. Conflicted adventurers tend not to live very long, even if they are interesting. This is enough musing for now. Talk to me again when you're ready for something to do.~ [mal_a1]
@13104 = ~But what? I assure you that not killing him would feel worse in the long run, considering that he would keep killing innocent people. We have blood on our hands and we bear whatever guilt we have, so that others don’t have to. You took the life in front of you, yes, but in doing so, you saved lives that you cannot see. Now, sort yourself out, <CHARNAME>. Conflicted adventurers tend not to live very long, even if they are interesting. This is enough musing for now. Talk to me again when you're ready for something to do.~ [mal_con]
@13105 = ~I don’t know, to be honest. It seems that we are similar, you and I. Sometimes, taking a life is the best or only course of action. But there’s no need to keep musing. Talk to me again when you're ready for something to do.~ [mal_c3]
@13106 = ~Well, you’ve certainly found your calling then. Malar would be pleased with you, I think. Adventuring is a violent and challenging profession. But do be careful of your targets—indiscriminate killing is an excellent way to become hunted by the dogs of justice, and throwing yourself at challenges is an excellent way to get in over your head and get yourself killed that way. But that’s enough preaching from me. Talk to me again when you're ready for something to do.~ [mal_c4]
@13107 = ~Now, I’ve got a task that requires some discretion. The Helmites in Nashkel want one of us to investigate something, and so I’m sending you. Their grave keeper has lost a body, and the family is naturally furious. And they became even angrier when the Helmites suggested that their dearly departed had become undead, so don’t expect a warm welcome. Naturally, everyone wants to keep a missing body and possibility of undead on the downlow. Nashkel has enough problems as-is. Anyway, figure out what happened to the body, won’t you? Any questions?~ [nas_0]
@13108 = ~What can you tell me about the missing body?~
@13109 = ~Why does anyone suspect undead?~
@13110 = ~What other problems does Nashkel have?~
@13111 = ~Why me for this?~
@13112 = ~Elderly human male, died of natural causes, so far as we know. Had a Helmite funeral—not unusual in Nashkel. By all accounts, everything was perfectly normal. Except for the part where he’s gone. Anything else?~ [nas_01]
@13113 = ~Well, when a body disappears from its grave, there are two options: either the body became undead and walked off on its own, or there’s an active graverobber. Your task is to find out which and solve the problem. Anything else?~ [nas_02]
@13114 = ~<CHARNAME>, did you just leave a secluded monastery or something? Nashkel depends heavily on its iron mine, but with the Iron Crisis… The iron from Nashkel’s mine is tainted somehow. It’s brittle and breaks easily. Additionally, I hear that something happened with their guard commander. He killed several people before disappearing. It’s a tumultuous time for Nashkel, certainly. Don’t make it worse. Anything else?~ [nas_03]
@13115 = ~Well, normally, we’d send one of our clerics, but they’re a bit busy, considering the bandit problems. You have experience putting the dead to rest and with killing necromancers. No matter what the issue is, you have experience with it. Besides, there’s plenty to see and do in Nashkel. If the mines aren’t your speed, then I hear the carnival is lovely. Anything else?~ [nas_04]
@13116 = ~Good. Godspeed, <CHARNAME>.~ [nas_05]
@13117 = ~Get to your task, <CHARNAME>.  ~
@13118 = ~How goes your task?~
@13119 = ~Turns out that the man rose from the dead, because he was unhappy with the Helmite funeral that he had. He was a follower of Ibrandul and wanted a funeral according to that faith.~
@13120 = ~Hm. Interesting. The dead are picky about their funerals sometimes. Ibrandul is interesting, as he’s allied with both Mask and Ilmater, who are enemies themselves. He’s also diametrically opposed to Lathander. I’m curious, <CHARNAME>--when you find yourself in the company of someone diametrically opposed to your faith, what do you think you’ll do?~ [nas_06]
@13121 = ~Well, I'm working with you, aren't I?~
@13122 = ~My faith stands for Good, so anyone diametrically opposed would be Evil. I would do what was necessary.~
@13123 = ~I don’t think I’d do anything. Everything has its place in the grand scheme of things.~
@13124 = ~Such a massive disagreement would only lead to violence in the end.~
@13125 = ~I don’t think I’d be able to persuade them of anything, but I can at least set an example that there are other ways to live.~
@13126 = ~I'm honestly not certain.~
@13127 = ~Ha! Fair enough, <CHARNAME>, fair enough. That is one thing that I appreciate about you. Talk to me again when you're ready for something to do.~ [nas_07]
@13128 = ~And how do you determine what is necessary? How do you decide when to let Evil live, and when to condemn Evil to die? If we killed Evil whenever we see it, no one would get a chance to redeem themselves. We’d be damning everyone we come across. But if we let Evil live all the time, would we be partially responsible for the evil acts that they commit later? Hm. But I suppose there’s no point in musing about it now. Talk to me again when you're ready for something to do.~ [3dhow]
@13129 = ~The darkness helps us appreciate the dawn, is that it? Hm. Not sure I agree with that, but there’s no time for musings. Talk to me again when you're ready for something to do.~ [3ddd]
@13130 = ~And who would be the instigator in such a situation? Sometimes, who we perceive as an enemy can give us a pleasant surprise. Perhaps it is wiser to stay your hand and see what comes of the situation. Talk to me again when you're ready for something to do.~ [3dinst]
@13131 = ~And then if they get curious enough, they can learn more themselves, is that it? That sometimes works. Talk to me again when you're ready for something to do.~ [3dcur]
@13132 = ~You might want to think about it–something like this may happen sooner than you expect. Talk to me again when you're ready for something to do.~ [3didk]
@13133 = ~I hope you won’t mind a departure from the norm here. No undead, necromancers, or cultists this time. One of the locals is having a rat problem, and I want you to deal with it. She lives near the Burning Wizard. Any questions?~
@13134 = ~You want me to take care of a bunch of rats?~ [4star]
@13135 = ~Well, I never said that every task I send you on would be exciting and glamorous, did I? The Temple has a responsibility to Beregost and its citizenry. The homeowners asked the Flaming Fist before coming to us, but the Fist refused, of course. Don’t be so glum, perhaps something interesting will turn up. And besides, isn’t dealing with a rat problem a rite of passage for adventurers? Anything else?~ [4glum]
@13136 = ~Good.~ [4rgood]
@13137 = ~Come back when you've resolved the situation.~ [4rnoye]
@13138 = ~A lycanthrope? Here? By the Morninglord… I wish I could join you for this. But I can still help from here. Try to avoid a fight and do what you can to convince the wererat to leave peacefully. He hasn’t been violent yet, so I think there’s a chance. And here’s a silver dagger, just in case. Unfortunately, I only have the one. And good luck, <CHARNAME>.~ [4yikes]
@13139 = ~Come back when you've resolved the situation. And good luck.~ [4noye2]
@13140 = ~I've slain the wererat.~
@13141 = ~So, I’m curious. Why kill the lycanthrope? I’m sure it was a difficult fight.~ [4whyk]
@13142 = ~Lycanthropes are evil; I couldn’t let him live.~
@13143 = ~Lycanthropes are too dangerous, especially near civilization. It was too risky to not kill him.~
@13144 = ~I wanted a difficult fight.~
@13145 = ~I couldn’t convince him. It was my only option.~
@13146 = ~Irredeemably evil by virtue of existence? That’s cold, <CHARNAME>. What of the Selunite lycanthropes? Well, let’s hope there’s never any surprises about what *you* are. Ah, but we don’t have time to dwell on this now. Talk to me again when you want something to do.~ [4ouch]
@13147 = ~I wonder, <CHARNAME>…. Will there ever be a time when *you* become so dangerous and powerful that someone believes that you’re too risky to stay alive? Ah, but we don’t have time to dwell on this now. Talk to me again when you want something to do.~ [4risk]
@13148 = ~Did you? I’m sure you got one. I wonder if someone should ever believe the same of you. What then? Though perhaps you’d relish the opportunity. Ah, but we don’t have time for this. Talk to me again when you want something to do.~ [4relish]
@13149 = ~That’s unfortunate, but it’s reality. I’m sorry, <CHARNAME>, I really am. Ah, but I’m afraid we don’t have any time. Talk to me again when you want something to do.~ [4roops]
@13150 = ~The rats were led by a lycanthrope, and I convinced them to leave for the warrens that the Malarite used to occupy.~
@13151 = ~So, I’m curious. Why keep the lycanthrope alive?~ [4rwhya]
@13152 = ~He wasn’t hostile. I’m not attacking someone who doesn’t want to fight. It’s wrong and dishonorable.~
@13153 = ~He wasn’t doing anything wrong. He didn’t deserve to die just because he’s a wererat.~
@13154 = ~I just really, really didn’t want to fight a lycanthrope.~
@13155 = ~Dishonorable? Yes, I suppose we all have some guiding principles. Or should, anyway. Good on you, <CHARNAME>.Talk to me again when you want something to do.~ [4rdish]
@13156 = ~So we can’t help what we are, but we can help who we become. Is that it? I truly hope you’re correct, <CHARNAME>. Really I do. And I wish that more people would agree with you. Ah, no point dwelling on this though.Talk to me again when you want something to do.~ [4rwho]
@13157 = ~Cowardly, but sometimes cowardice keeps you alive. Talk to me again when you want something to do.~ [4rcow]
@13158 = ~Now, I’d love to take the time to have one of our chats, but… there’s a Zhent agent on the way from the Friendly Arm Inn to Beregost. Kill him. Questions?~ [5zhst]
@13159 = ~Just kill him? Not even talk first?~
@13160 = ~What should I look for?~
@13161 = ~The only good Zhent is a dead one, <CHARNAME>. There is the occasional renegade, but that’s not the situation at hand. Anything else?~ [5dead]
@13162 = ~It’s a straight shot between here and the Friendly Arm. He’d be a fool to walk on the path, but he’d also be a fool to stray too far from it. And Zhent field agents aren’t exactly known for their subtlety. He shouldn’t be too hard to find. Anything else?~ [5where]
@13163 = ~Kill the Zhentarim agent, <CHARNAME>. ~ [5kill]
@13164 = ~Hello again, <CHARNAME>. How goes your task?~ [5done]
@13165 = ~The Zhent agent is dead, though he had some things to say first.~
@13166 = ~Did he now?~ [5did]
@13167 = ~He called me your newest toy.~
@13168 = ~Are you a Harper? Is that why you sent me after the Zhent?~
@13169 = ~Why does a Zhent know about you?~
@13170 = ~Let's move on.~
@13171 = ~Did he now? You’re not the first person I’ve sent out into the field. And I doubt you’ll be my last—not because I expect you to die or anything mind you. I’m hoping that you move on for one reason or another. Anything else?~ [5move]
@13172 = ~What? No. I’m not nearly—nevermind. I most certainly am not. Anything else?~ [5harp]
@13173 = ~He called me your ‘newest toy’.~
@13174 = ~You mean besides the fact that I’m a Lathanderite, which they hate on principle? And that I go after criminals, which they are? And have been for some time now? It’d be strange if they didn’t know about me. Anything else?~ [5know]
@13175 = ~Gladly. When you're ready for another mission, come talk to me. And here's some gold for your trouble.~ [5end]
@13176 = ~Alright, now that’s behind us. I’m sending you after Lenovola, a rather notorious cannibal. She’s a halfling—though she also eats more than just halflings, so don’t go thinking that any of you are safe either. She’s been preying on people traveling between Beregost and Nashkel, and she’s been spotted near Gullykin from time to time as well. I’d look around the Lonely Peaks. Careful she doesn’t eat you—a mutilated or desecrated body cannot be raised from the dead. If she eats you or any of your companions, there won’t be a damn thing anyone can do about it. Other than kill her, of course. Any questions?~ [6start]
@13177 = ~Any chance of talking to her first?~
@13178 = ~Depends on how hungry she is. In all seriousness, it’s unlikely. Cannibalism is her choice, and I doubt she’ll be deterred from it. Anything else?~ [6choi]
@13179 = ~Complete your task.~ [6comp]
@13180 = ~Ah, you're back and still alive. Excellent. Talk to me again when you're ready for your next task. And here--take this ring. It'll help prevent anyone from cooking you in the future.~ [can_0]
@13181 = ~I’ve heard rumors that the bandits are operating in the forests nearby. A Shadow Thief must have also heard these rumors, since he left Amn and went straight for the forests. To the best of our knowledge, he hasn’t left the woods yet. Regardless, if the Shadow Thieves are interested in the bandits for whatever reason, that's something worth knowing. Find the Shadow Thief and find out whatever you can. There’s a chance that he’s already made his way to wherever the bandit camp is, so you may need to find that first. Any questions?~ [ban_0]
@13182 = ~Where’s the Bandit Camp?~
@13183 = ~What’s a Shadow Thief doing around here?~
@13184 = ~No more questions. I'm on it.~
@13185 = ~I don’t know. Only the bandits themselves do. You’ll need to get some sort of lead, and I’m afraid I can’t help you there. Anything else?~ [ban_01]
@13186 = ~I’m not sure. That’s what I want you to find out. Anything else?~ [ban_02]
@13187 = ~The Shadow Thief was a renegade. He went to the bandits because he thought they were the only ones who would accept him after his crimes. I directed him here.~
@13188 = ~Oh? What influenced that decision?~ [ban_03]
@13189 = ~He might deserve death for his crimes, but that’s not for me to decide.~
@13190 = ~He seemed repentant, and I thought he deserved a second chance.~
@13191 = ~I really didn’t want to fight a Shadow Thief when there were so many bandits around to deal with.~
@13192 = ~So, you don’t want to be the judge, the jury, and the executioner? I can agree with that. Usually. Regardless, I have something else for you. Talk to me again when you're ready.~ [ban_04]
@13193 = ~ You’re a credit to your faith, <CHARNAME>. Talk to me again when you're ready.~ [ban_05]
@13194 = ~Oh? Am I starting to rub off on you? Perhaps I’ll make a Lathanderite out of you yet! Jests aside, I do have something else for you. Talk to me again when you're ready.~ [ban_06]
@13195 = ~That’s practical of you.Regardless, I have something else for you. Talk to me again when you're ready.~ [ban_07]
@13196 = ~The Shadow Thief was a renegade. He went to the bandits because he thought they were the only ones who would accept him after his crimes. I killed him.~
@13197 = ~He deserved death for what he did as a Shadow Thief.~
@13198 = ~ He might have been lying about being a renegade. I didn’t want to risk Shadow Thief involvement with the bandits.~
@13199 = ~ I’ve never fought a Shadow Thief before, and I was curious.~
@13200 = ~No second chances? People can change in surprising ways, <CHARNAME>. Since he was a renegade–well, I suppose we’ll never know now. Regardless, I have something else for you. Talk to me again when you're ready.~ [ban_08]
@13201 = ~Oh. Yes, I suppose if he was being dishonest, he could have created a lot of trouble for everyone down the road. Last thing we need are the Shadow Thieves getting involved in…. Whatever is going on. Regardless, I have something else for you. Talk to me again when you're ready.~ [ban_09]
@13202 = ~You’ve never fought a lot of things before, <CHARNAME>. If I sent you to meet a dragon, would you kill that too? Regardless, I have something else for you. Perhaps it will help quench that bloodlust of yours. Talk to me again when you're ready.~ [ban_10]
@13203 = ~Have you heard of the Ulcaster Ruins? It was a school of wizardry founded some centuries ago by the conjurer Ulcaster under the guidance of Aumvor the Undying, a Netherese lich. Anyway, the school was destroyed some time ago, and there’s been undead in the area ever since. The undead, naturally, attract necromancers. We occasionally go clear the place out, but everyone is so busy with banditry and the Iron Crisis. You see where I’m going with this, don’t you? Go to the Ulcaster Ruins, find the latest residential necromancer, and remove him. Any questions?~ [ul_01]
@13204 = ~Careful in the ruins. We haven’t been able to pay a visit in some time, so I imagine that there’s all kinds of things crawling around down there. As for fighting a necromancer, do try to prevent him from getting spells off. Anything else?~ [ul_02]
@13205 = ~Good. Lathander go with you. And take these arrows. They're quite useful against spellcasters. Ah, and your reward for your previous mission--a guard's ring. It may be helpful in the future.~ [ul_03]
@13206 = ~Good. Lathander go with you. And take these arrows. They're quite useful against spellcasters. Ah, and your reward for your previous mission--a druid's ring. It may be helpful in the future.~ [ul_04]
@13207 = ~Good. Lathander go with you. And take these arrows. They're quite useful against spellcasters. Ah, and your reward for your previous mission--a Ring of Acuity. It may be helpful in the future.~ [ul_05]
@13208 = ~Ah, <CHARNAME>. There you are. Perfect timing. <CHARNAME>, when you cleared out the Bandit Camp, you must’ve missed a bandit. Or perhaps he just wasn’t at the camp at the time. Regardless, he’s here now, and I’m calling on you to arbitrate something between me and this Flaming Fist officer. <CHARNAME>, the situation is this. This individual here participated in banditry. He is repentant and is seeking sanctuary in this Temple. He is willing to study here and learn the teachings of Lathander, and I think his remorse is genuine. But the Temple and the Fist are at odds here, and I'm calling on you to be the jury. Let me know when you've decided.~ [jj_01]
@13209 = ~Well, <CHARNAME>? Your decision?~ [jj_02]
@13210 = ~He deserves the hangman’s noose for his crimes.~
@13211 = ~ He needs to face justice, but he doesn’t have to die. Lock him up for a while instead. He can learn Lathander’s teachings behind bars.~
@13212 = ~He’s repentant. Let him stay here.~
@13213 = ~I'm still thinking.~
@13214 = ~Perhaps–no. We all had an agreement. I am sorry, Ovlin. The gods know the truth, and I trust that they will have mercy on your soul. <CHARNAME>, talk to me when you're ready for your next task.~ [jj_03]
@13215 = ~A compromise, is it? Better than some of the alternatives, that’s for sure. <CHARNAME>, talk to me when you're ready for your next task.~ [jj_04]
@13216 = ~We’ll take full responsibility for him, if it makes you feel better, Officer. Now, unless you have something else…? And <CHARNAME>, talk to me when you're ready for your next task. ~ [jj_05]
@13217 = ~Take your time to think about it. ~ [jj_06]
@13218 = ~I have something of a delicate nature for you. I got word of a renegade Zhent in Cloakwood, and I want you to invite him here. I’m not sure exactly where in Cloakwood he is–likely deep enough to avoid civilization, but not so deep as to run into Shadow Druids. Find him and send him here, understood?~ [rz_01]
@13219 = ~Why not kill him? I thought the only good Zhent was a dead one?~
@13220 = ~Why do you want him here?~
@13221 = ~Are you sure you aren’t a Harper?~
@13222 = ~He’s not a Zhent anymore. He defected; he’s a renegade. Does that clear it up for you? Anything else?~ [rz_02]
@13223 = ~Because if he’s not here or with the Ilmateri, he’s as good as dead. Lathander teaches redemption, <CHARNAME>, even for Zhents. Anything else?~ [rz_03]
@13224 = ~Yes, I am quite sure. Quit asking that. Anything else?~ [rz_04]
@13225 = ~Rescue the renegade, <CHARNAME>. ~ [rz_05]
@13226 = ~I sent the Zhent off this way. There were other Zhents about to kill him, but they’re dead now. The other Zhents called me your “attack dog”.~
@13227 = ~Mm, I suppose that’s not entirely inaccurate, is it? Regardless, good work, <CHARNAME>. I have another mission for you–less dramatic this time, I think. Talk to me when you're ready.~ [rz_06]
@13228 = ~Really? They called you that? How strange. You aren’t a particularly violent sort–definitely not as bloodthirsty as they are. Regardless, good work, <CHARNAME>. I have another mission for you–less dramatic this time, I think. Talk to me when you're ready.~ [rz_07]
@13229 = ~I killed the renegade Zhent.~
@13230 = ~You WHAT?! I very specifically told you not to do that, <CHARNAME>! I don’t care what your reasoning was. Get out of here!~ [rz_08]
@13231 = ~Get out, <CHARNAME>.~ [rz_09]
@13232 = ~The Helmites in Baldur’s Gate had some papers that they thought I could decipher for them. Do me a favor and go get them for me. Arteger will be at the Helmite Temple, naturally. Any questions?~ [p_01]
@13233 = ~Why do they think you can decipher the papers? Why not ask a Candlekeep scholar?~
@13234 = ~Why don’t you get the papers?~
@13235 = ~I’m not entirely certain, and I won’t be until I have those papers. You can satisfy both of our curiosities by bringing those papers here. Anything else?~ [p_02]
@13236 = ~Because I am loath to leave the temple. You, however, don’t seem to mind leaving so much. Anything else?~ [p_03]
@13237 = ~Bring me those papers. ~ [p_04]
@13238 = ~Ah, I see you have the papers. Hm. Let me see those. Ah. Yes. I can definitely see… Hm. Unfortunately, it looks like I ought to go to the Gate myself. I’ll likely have other missions for you–meet me at the Helmite Temple.~ [p_05]
@13239 = ~Ah, <CHARNAME>, there you are. Excellent. I have a mission for you, naturally. I may have overheard some Helmites talking about a particular follower of Loviatar. She’s in Baldur’s Gate as a defector and wants to make amends with the Ilmateri. The Helmites, of course, want to bring her to justice, which likely means the hangman’s noose. Personally, I think the Ilmateri should decide what to do with her. I would have you find her and give her this invisibility ring. The tricky part is figuring out where she’s staying. Oh, and the Helmites don’t know that we know about her, so I’d appreciate it if you kept this between us. Any questions?~ [lov_01]
@13240 = ~What do you mean that the Helmites don’t know that we know about her?~
@13241 = ~Why let the Ilmateri decide what to do with her?~
@13242 = ~You seem unusually invested in this particular case.~
@13243 = ~Any ideas where to look?~
@13244 = ~Eavesdropping, <CHARNAME>. It’s a wonder what people will say when they don’t know you’re there or realize that you’re listening. Anything else?~ [lov_02]
@13245 = ~From what I overheard, most of her crimes were against the Ilmateri. As such, we should let them decide what to do with her, don’t you think? Anything else?~ [lov_3]
@13246 = ~I… I’m not any more invested in this case than the others. She’s a renegade, and I want her to have a chance to redeem herself, same as the renegade Zhent I sent you to find. Anything else?~ [lov_04]
@13247 = ~Hm. Loviatans can be rather decadent, so she might be in a high-end tavern. But they’re also rather calculating, so she might have intentionally gone with a low-end one. But she might know that we might think that. Just check wherever people might stay, <CHARNAME>. Anything else?~ [lov_05]
@13248 = ~Good. I hope you find her before the Fist or Paladins do.~ [lov_06]
@13249 = ~Deliver that ring.~
@13250 = ~Ah, you're back. Tell me, <CHARNAME>, in this case, why did you do what I asked?~ [lov_08]
@13251 = ~You seemed oddly invested in this, so I figured it must be important.~
@13252 = ~Because you told me to.~
@13253 = ~Because I think she should have a chance.~
@13254 = ~Do I seem so? Hm. I suppose it is important to me, in a way. Moving on, I have another mission for you. Talk to me when you're ready.~ [lov_09]
@13255 = ~Is that really it, <CHARNAME>? If I told you to–no, this isn’t fair of me. Moving on, I have another mission for you.~ [lov_10]
@13256 = ~I’m glad we agree. Moving on, I have another mission for you. Talk to me when you're ready.~ [lov_11]
@13257 = ~I killed the renegade Lovitaran.~
@13258 = ~Ah, <CHARNAME>. Here’s something interesting for you - there’s been reports of a doppelganger in the sewers. The Fist wants the doppelganger dead, of course, but I am awfully curious. You almost never see a doppelganger in its true form, and I can’t help but wonder why this doppelganger isn’t hiding within society like most of its kind does. Go investigate, won’t you?~ [dop_01]
@13259 = ~Do you think this doppelganger has anything to do with the unrest in the City?~
@13260 = ~I'm on it.~
@13261 = ~Unlikely. If this doppelganger was trying to cause problems, it wouldn’t be in its true form. ~ [dop_02]
@13262 = ~Good. I hope you find it before the Fist does.~ [dop_03]
@13263 = ~Figure out what's going on.~
@13264 = ~Ah, <CHARNAME>, you're back. Thank the gods.~ [dop_04]
@13265 = ~The doppelganger just wanted to live as it is, and so I let it live.~
@13266 = ~Good choice, <CHARNAME>. Perhaps… perhaps there is hope yet. But there’s no time for musings, I have something extremely urgent for you. Talk to me again as soon as you can.~ [dop_05]
@13267 = ~The doppelganger is dead–I couldn’t let such a monster live.~
@13268 = ~I suppose that this is why they stay hidden, <CHARNAME>. And... why other people lie and hide themselves as well. Judgment can be violent.  But there’s no time for musings, I have something extremely urgent for you.Talk to me again as soon as you can.~ [dop_06]
@13269 = ~The Undercellars, beneath the Blushing Mermaid. A big-name Zhentarim assassin, Mordiyin, is there. He needs to die, <CHARNAME>. Questions?~ [fin_01]
@13270 = ~Why don't you do it?~
@13271 = ~How do you know this?~
@13272 = ~Why not get the Fist?~
@13273 = ~Why not get the Harpers?~
@13274 = ~This isn’t some sort of trap, is it?~
@13275 = ~What can you tell me about Mordiyin?~
@13276 = ~No more questions, I'm on it.~
@13277 = ~I… don’t trust myself. Too much history here. Anything else?~ [fin_02]
@13278 = ~Remember those papers you got for me from the Helmites? The reason I came to Baldur’s Gate, instead of staying in Beregost? They were Zhentarim papers. It wasn’t too hard for me to break the code, and that’s how I found out. Anything else?~ [fin_03]
@13279 = ~The Fist? Are we thinking of the same organization? The Fist can’t even handle bandits, how are they going to handle the Zhentarim? They’re not. It’s going to be a slaughter, assuming the Fist can even muster the courage to face them. Anything else?~ [fin_04]
@13280 = ~Good luck finding any in time. Assuming you do find them, they are going to have a lot of questions, and they’ll waste time asking them, and you’ll waste time having to answer them. Much like we’re doing now. Anything else?~ [fin_05]
@13281 = ~Of course, <CHARNAME>, I’ve spent all this time building you up only to lead you into a trap like a lamb to slaughter. No, this isn’t a trap. Anything else?~ [fin_06]
@13282 = ~We were partners once. I’ve dodged and killed a number of other assassins from the Zhentil Keep, and it seems like they finally sent Mordiyin. He knows me well enough, and I’m assuming that they know that I’m too sentimental these days. I… I don’t know if I can face him, which is why I’m sending you. And be careful–he’s competent enough in direct combat, and he has some magical ability. I don’t know what he’s capable of exactly these days; I haven’t been keeping tabs on him. Perhaps that was a mistake on my part. Anything else?~ [fin_07]
@13283 = ~Godspeed, <CHARNAME>.~ [fin_08]
@13284 = ~Kill Mordiyin, <CHARNAME>. Soon. Please.~ [fin_09]
@13285 = ~Oh, <CHARNAME>! You're back.~ [fin_10]
@13286 = ~Yes, and Mordiyin had some interesting things to say.~
@13287 = ~Yes, I suppose he did.. I should be honest with you. I was a Zhent agent once. An enforcer. I hunted our enemies without pity or remorse, and anyone who opposed us, anyone who so much as helped those who stood against us... I slaughtered innocents for the crime of harboring renegades. A whole temple of Ilmateri, and they did not raise a hand against me. I have tried to escape my past. To be better. Lathander promises a new day, but I cannot escape the shadow of my sins. The Zhentarim say, once a Zhent, always a Zhent, and I have come to realize the truth of it. I’ve even tried redeeming other renegades, but… when I say that the only good Zhent is a dead Zhent, trust that I know what I am talking about. So I have one final task for you, <CHARNAME>. I want you to witness my death.~ [fin_11]
@13288 = ~Don't be absurd. You realize that I'm no saint either? If you damn yourself, you're damning me alongside with you.~
@13289 = ~Neither of us are saints, Eloran, but surely who we become matters as much--if not more than--who we've been? (NOTE: this will shift your alignment to Chaotic Neutral)~

@13304 = ~Perhaps... Do you really have that much faith in me, <CHARNAME>, even now knowing what I am - what I was? You believe that I still should have a chance? I... I need to think about this. And I can't stay in the Gate any longer, now that the Zhentarim know I'm here. Goodbye, <CHARNAME>. And thank you.~ [fin_12]
@13305 = ~You truly believe that, don’t you? Fine. I just hope that I don’t make things worse somehow. Gods know I’ve done enough damage already. Since you want me to stay alive so badly, I’ll… I’ll have to leave the Gate. now that the Zhentarim know I'm here. Goodbye, <CHARNAME>. I hope this isn’t just another mistake.~ [fin_13]
